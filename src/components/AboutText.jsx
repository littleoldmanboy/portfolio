            <h2>DENNIS RUSSELL</h2>
            <p>
                I'm 27 years old, based in Aarhus, Denmark, and I’m studying Multimedia Design, specializing in Frontend Development.
                <br/><br/>
                My biggest passion is creating aesthetically appealing digital experiences - whether it’s visual or sound.
                <br/><br/>
                I thrive on the intersection of art and technology.
