                With a year of dedicated learning, my competencies are rapidly evolving across diverse domains.
                <br /><br />
                While my experience in the visual dimension and web development is still budding, I'm committed to continuous growth. I'm eager to explore front-end development further, as I'm looking for expanding my knowledge through hands-on experiences, making an internship the next exciting step in my journey.
